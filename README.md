# PYnative Python Pandas Exercise

## Overview

The PYnative Python Pandas Exercise project is designed to help Python developers learn and practice Pandas, a powerful data analysis library. Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed library that provides data structures and functions to work with structured data.

This project includes a set of exercises and solutions covering various Pandas topics, such as DataFrame, data selection, group-by, series, sorting, searching, and statistics. The exercises use the "Automobile Dataset" for data analysis, which includes information about various car attributes.

## Exercise Topics

The exercises in this project cover a wide range of Pandas topics:

- Exercise 1: Display the first and last five rows of the dataset.
- Exercise 2: Clean the dataset by replacing specific values with NaN.
- Exercise 3: Find the most expensive car company and its price.
- Exercise 4: Print details of all Toyota cars.
- Exercise 5: Count the total number of cars for each company.
- Exercise 6: Find the highest-priced car for each company.
- Exercise 7: Calculate the average mileage for each car manufacturer.
- Exercise 8: Sort all cars by the 'price' column.
- Exercise 9: Concatenate two data frames based on specific conditions.
- Exercise 10: Merge two data frames and append one as a new column.

## Usage

To run these exercises, you need Python and Pandas installed on your system. You can execute each exercise by opening the respective Python script in your code editor and running it.
